Folder Analyses contains code written by Ritwika in MATLAB R2019a to 

i) generate necessary data files from (LENA and human listeners) to be analysed in subsequent steps (folder Generating_matfiles)

ii) analyse data obtained from LENA (folder LENA_data_analysis)

iii) analyse data obtained from human listeners and the corresponding subset of LENA data (human_labelled_data_analysis)

iv) plot relevant results (Plots)

Folder Analyses also contains code written by Ritwika in R and MATLAB R2019a (R version 3.5.2 (2018-12-20) -- "Eggshell Igloo") to carry out 
statistical tests on results obtained from (ii) and (iii). All R code is in folder stats_R and_matlab.

Please execute .m files from folders in the order specified in (i)-(iv), followed by code in stats_R and_matlab.

In addition, subfolder AIC_Theo_Rhodes_code contains code written by Dr. Theo Rhodes. This code was used in analysing step size distributions using AIC criterion. Make sure that this folder is in the path while running AIC criterion-based step size analyses.
