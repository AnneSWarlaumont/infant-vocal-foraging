This folder contains code to analyse data labelled by human listeners.

Subfolders include

1) Correlation_hum: has .m files to find correlation (using MATLAB's corrcoef) between steps in time and acoustic space for adult and child vocalisations, based on data labelled by human listeners

2)Stepsize_analysis_hum: has .m files that find AIC best fits for distributions of step sizes in frequency, amplitude, acoustic space and time, for WR and WOR adult and chils vocalisations (based on human labelled data)

3)logistic_regression_hum: has .m files to generate data for logistic regression on human-labelled data.
