Files in this folder are required to run a significant chunk of the step size distributions analyses - essentially, 
anything that uses AIC criterion requires these files.

These files were written by Dr. Theo Rhodes who was a postdoc with Prof. Chris Kello and who is now a faculty at 
SUNY Oswego. The aicplots.m function file was adapted from Dr. Rhodes's code by Ritwika to generate plots.

Make sure that the files in this folder is in the path while running MATLAB code for step size analyses using AIC.
