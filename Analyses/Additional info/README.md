This folder has a .cdf file showing how exponential, pareto, and lognormal distributions vary as a function of their mean and 
standard deviation (Distribution_tails.cdf). It also shows how lognormal and pareto distributions vary as a function of their parameters (lognormal_pareto_distributions.cdf). Note that this will require a .cdf player Note that this requires mathematica or other .cdf player.
