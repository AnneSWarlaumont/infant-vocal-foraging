All additional information that might be helpful is here:

- A .cdf file showing how exponential, pareto, and lognormal distributions vary as a 
function of their mean and standard deviation (Distribution_tails.cdf). Note that this requires mathematica or other .cdf player. 

- A .cdf file showing how lognormal and pareto distributions vary as a function of their parameters (lognormal_pareto_distributions.cdf). once again, this will require a .cdf player
