This folder contains .m files used to determine median and 90th percentile values for infant and adult step sizes as a function of of number of vocalisations since a response was last received. Here, the step from the vocalisation that received a response to the next vocalization was assigned 0, the following step (assuming no response to the second vocalization) was designated 1, and so on. This continued until the next response was received at whichpoint the count resets to 0 (see paper and supplementary information for details). These were prelimiary analyses only and resultant plots can be found in SI. Also not that these analyses were carried out with all infant data pooled together (and similarly for adult data)
