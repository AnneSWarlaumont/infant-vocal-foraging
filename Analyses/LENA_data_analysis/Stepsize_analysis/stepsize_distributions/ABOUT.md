This folder contains .m files used to analyse step-size distributions near responses (WR) and away from responses (WOR) as defined in the paper, both in terms of fit-dependent parameters and fit-independent parameters (eg. median and 90th percentile values). These analyses were carried out at the recording day level.

.m files in this folder can be executed in any order.

stepsizedist_noWR_WOR_advoc and stepsizedist_noWR_WOR_chvoc determines best fit distributions for step sizes in frequency, amplitude, 2d acoustic space and time, for adult and infant vocalisations, respectively. These analyses are carried out at the recording day level. 

stepsizedist_WR_WOR_advoc and stepsizedist_WR_WOR_chvoc determines best fit distributions for step sizes follwoing a response (WR) and not following a response (WOR) in frequency, amplitude, 2d acoustic space and time, for adult and infant vocalisations, respectively. These analyses are carried out at the recording day level.
