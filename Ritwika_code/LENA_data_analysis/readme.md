This directory contains files to analyse all the recordings as labelled by LENA. Run the files in generating_data_files 
before running files here. Within this directory, run these first (in no particular order):

- adresp_stepsizepattern_onevoc.m
- adresp_stepsizepattern_timewin.m
- chresp2ad_stepsizedist_onevoc.m
- chresp2ad_stepsizedist_timewin.m
- adultvoc_mean_step_sizes.m
- chnvoc_mean_stepsizes.m

note that I use the terms "arearest" and "1v" interchangeable in naming .csv files. I did not bother to fix this since most of 
my .csv files are named in the "arearest" convention. But this is apurely nomenclatural issue, and hopefully, will not be a point 
of confusion. Wherever the term "arearest" comes up, it is referring to the 1V scheme of definig which step sizes are in the 
vicinity of response and which ones are not. 

Similarly, for the mean step size analysis, I have used the terms "3bin" in place of what is the 4B scheme, and "2voc" in place 
of what is the "2S" scheme. This is once again a nomenclatural issue and it was simply too much effort to change all my .csv 
filenames once I had them. 

(The terms 1V, 2S, etc. emerged later in the writing process)
